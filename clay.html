              <h5>CLASSES</h5>
              Classes are not sold as a series. Any student—whether a total novice or working on more advanced skills—can come to any class and your instructor will work with you at your current level. Our thinking is that you take exactly as many classes as you need/want and practice during open studio.
              <br>
              <br>
              <h5>OPEN STUDIO</h5>
              Open Studio gives students freedom and time for independent practice. These are un-guided, 3-hour sessions that require a sign up. There will be a Pip person around to answer questions, but not to teach, so if you're a beginner, we ask that you first take one of our classes. (We also ask that you please clean up your wheel and space when you're finished!)
              <br>
              <br>
              <h5>PACKAGES</h5>
              We offer 4 and 8-packs for both classes and open studio. If you buy a package, you'll be sent a code to use when booking.
              Can I share? Yes! You can use your 4 or 8-pack to book classes for more than 1 person. The more the merrier!
              <br>
              <br>
              <h5>WHY WON'T THE SITE LET ME SIGN UP?!?!</h5>
              The class or open studio session is full. Unfortunately, the software we use just removes full sessions from the calendar rather than leaving them there and marking them as "sold out". It's confusing. We're sorry.
              <br>
              <br>
              <h5>CAN I CANCEL/RESCHEDULE?</h5>
              We don't allow cancellations or refunds for any of our classes, courses, open studio sessions or workshops. 
              Our studio is small and we staff according to sign ups. Thanks for your understanding. 
              You can reschedule your class/session up to 48 hours ahead of time by clicking the button in your confirmation email.
              <br>
              <br>
              <h5>OTHER STUFF</h5>
              What to wear/bring? Wear clothes you don't mind getting dirty! You might also bring an apron (we have great Pip aprons for sale in the studio). 
              Please wear a mask when in the studio and maybe cut your nails—long nails and wheel throwing don't mix! What about parties and special events? 
              We love to host special events in the studio—birthday parties, bachelor/ette parties, team building events and more. Visit our Special Events page for more info.
              <br>
              <br>
              <h3>The Process/Using the Studio</h3>
              <br>
              <h5>CLAY</h5>
              Reclaimed clay is included for your classes. We also sell several types of Laguna clay by the 25lb bag in the studio at competitive prices. You can also visit Marjon's for a much wider selection, but please remember that we only fire to cone 5-6.
              You can store your personal clay on the blue clay shelf in the studio for up to 1 month from date of purchase. 
              After that, you can come grab it and store it at home, or leave it with us and we'll recycle it! 
              <br>
              <br>
              <h5>GLAZES & FIRING</h5>
              Pip glazes are included for open studio and class participants as are both bisque and glaze firings. We fire to cone 5-6 and will not be firing work made outside the studio for now. We'll keep you posted on that one : )
              You can sign up to glaze for free during one of our classwork glazing sessions, Monday through Saturday if you've made something in one of our classes. Sign up here.
              <br>
              <br>
              <h5>WHERE SHOULD I PUT MY STUFF?</h5>
              <b>Work in progress:</b> Please put any work in progress (that you will be trimming) on the shelves in the kiln room. Don't forget to label and date it with the blue painter's tape on the hand building table.
              <br><b>Work to be fired:</b>  When your work is ready to fire—bisque or glaze—please put it on the carts in the studio.
              <br>
              <br>
              <h5>FIRING SCHEDULE</h5>
              Greenware to bisque: 1 week to 10 days
              Bisque to glaze fired: 10 days to 2 weeks
              If you've made work in class, it will likely be ready to glaze after 10 days. 
              Glazed pieces will be ready to pick up 10 days to 2 weeks after you place them on the glaze cart. We regularly post updates to our firing status on Instagram.
              <br>
              <br>
              <h5>WHERE ARE MY POTS?</h5>
              Bisqued and glaze-fired work is stored on the shelves in the hallway between the cafe and studio. 
              We ask that all work—whether fired or in-process—be tended to within 2 weeks of creation. 
              After 2 weeks, your pots will be stored in suite 4 in the hallway by the cafe. Work that is in suite 4 for longer than 2 weeks will go to the pottery gods (or the lizard rescue, or Valle de Sol).
